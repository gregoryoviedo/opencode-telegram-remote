# Product

This document defines what OpenCode Remote is, what it does today, what it
deliberately does not do, and where it is going next.

## Vision

OpenCode Remote turns Telegram into a thin remote control for a local
`opencode serve` instance. The bot is the only surface you interact with on
your phone; OpenCode keeps doing the work locally on your Mac.

A small Swift menu-bar wrapper for macOS is shipped alongside the bot so
that the same single-user workflow can be launched, supervised, and
configured from the system tray without bespoke shell glue.

## Target scenario

1. You work on a project locally with OpenCode (TUI or desktop).
2. You leave the computer.
3. Later, from your phone, you open the bot in Telegram.
4. You pick a project inside your workspace, switch to or create a session,
   and send prompts.
5. You check progress, run `/diff` and `/undo`, or jump back into `/sessions`.
6. When you return home, the local machine has already done the work.

On macOS the wrapper is the convenient launcher:

1. First run: open the app, fill `Settings…`, save.
2. Subsequent runs: the icon in the menu bar shows whether the bot is
   running; click toggles it, right-click opens the menu.
3. The "Iniciar al login" toggle makes the wrapper start itself at boot.

## Functional scope

### Implemented

#### Go bot (`remote-bot`)

- Long polling against `api.telegram.org` with a strict `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`
  whitelist.
- Recursive workspace navigation limited to `WORKSPACE_ROOT`; traversal and
  escaping symlinks are rejected.
- Project selection by recursive folder picker.
- Session list, switching and inline creation.
- `/status`, `/projects`, `/sessions`, `/diff`, `/changes`, `/undo`.
- Free-form text prompts forwarded to the active session.
- SQLite-backed runtime state (workspace, project, session, navigation).
- Configuration loaded from `.env` (with parent directory walk and
  `ENV_FILE` override).
- Local `opencode serve` lifecycle: the bot can launch, restart, and shut
  down the subprocess for you via `/init`, `/projects → Usar esta carpeta`
  and `OPENCODE_AUTOSTART`.
- `TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL` and `TELEGRAM_API_ROOT` for restricted networks.
  Both are parsed from the environment (or `.env`), so the Swift wrapper
  can pass them as real `proc.environment` values when launching the bot.
- Clean shutdown on `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`.
- Sentinel errors in `domain/errors.go` so every recoverable failure can
  be matched programmatically.

#### macOS wrapper (`OpenCodeRemote.app`)

- Menu-bar status icon with template rendering (auto-adapts to dark /
  light menu bars).
- Popover with a Bluetooth-style toggle for start / stop.
- Context menu (right-click) with status label, toggle, *Settings…*,
  *Abrir registro*, *Salir*.
- SwiftUI Settings window with: `WORKSPACE_ROOT` (with folder picker),
  `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`, `OPENCODE_PORT` (stepper),
  `OPENCODE_BIN`, `OPENCODE_AUTOSTART`, `REMOTE_STATE_PATH`,
  `TELEGRAM_API_ROOT`, `TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL`.
- Persistence in `UserDefaults` plus a `chmod 600` `.env` regenerated on
  every save inside `~/Library/Application Support/OpenCodeRemote/`.
- Logs at `~/Library/Logs/OpenCodeRemote/bot.log`, accessible from the
  popover menu.
- Auto-start at login via `SMAppService.mainApp` (Settings toggle).
- arm64-only build pipeline (`make app`) that compiles the Go binary,
  generates the icon set with `sips` + Pillow, generates the
  `xcodeproj` with XcodeGen, and produces an ad-hoc-signed `.app` in
  `dist/`.

### Out of scope (today)

- Multi-user access. The whitelist is a single ID.
- Concurrent interactive flows. One Telegram chat at a time.
- Multimedia (voice, image, document attachments).
- Universal macOS binary (arm64-only; no Intel slice).
- Scheduled tasks.
- i18n.
- SwiftUI tests (the Go side has full coverage; the wrapper relies on
  manual QA).
- Sandboxing or notarisation (the `.app` is ad-hoc signed and needs
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` on first launch).
- IPC beyond `Process` spawning between the Swift wrapper and the Go
  bot. The wrapper does not parse the bot's output.

## Trust boundaries

- The Telegram Bot API is the only network surface the Go bot depends
  on.
- `opencode serve` is assumed to be reachable on
  `127.0.0.1:<OPENCODE_PORT>`.
- The bot token and chat ID live in `.env` (or shell env), never in
  SQLite.
- SQLite stores the active project, active session and short-lived
  navigation state only.
- When the macOS wrapper is used, the `.env` it regenerates is written
  with mode `0600` inside `~/Library/Application Support/`, accessible
  only to the current user.
- The Swift wrapper never makes network calls. It only spawns the Go
  binary and supervises its lifecycle.

## Open task list

Items in priority order, intentionally small and incremental:

1. `/new`, `/abort`, `/detach` for explicit session lifecycle.
2. `/messages` listing prior prompts with **Revert** and **Fork** actions.
3. Persistent reply keyboard with the most common actions.
4. Auto-restart of `opencode serve` when health checks fail (localhost only).
5. Pinned live status message (project, session, model, changed files).
6. Scheduled tasks (`/task`, `/tasklist`).
7. Voice transcription via a Whisper-compatible API (opt-in).
8. `TELEGRAM_FORCE_IPV4` and richer proxy options for restricted networks
   (today only `TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL` is supported).
9. Swift unit tests for `ConfigStore`, `AppState` and
   `LoginItemManager` to lock in the wrapper behaviour without a
   manual QA cycle.

## Change policy

Each item on the task list is small enough to land in one focused change
with tests. Anything that touches the trust model (whitelist, workspace
validation, persistence of secrets) requires a focused review and a
documented test.

Items that change the interaction model (e.g. multi-user, multi-chat
parallel flows) are explicitly out of scope for the moment. See
`docs/DESIGN.md` for the rationale.
